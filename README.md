For more information follow the [docs page](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/api-guides/build-system.html#start-a-new-project)

## How to use
Use the example as a template for the new projects.
A recommended way is to follow the instructions on a [docs page](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/api-guides/build-system.html#start-a-new-project).

## Example folder contents

The project **esp1** contains source file in C language [randomGenerator.c](main/randomGenerator.c),[log.c](main/log.c),[main.c](main/main.c). The files are located in folder [main](main).

ESP-IDF projects are built using CMake. The project build configuration is contained in `CMakeLists.txt`
files that provide set of directives and instructions describing the project's source files and targets
(executable, library, or both). 

Additionally, the _Server_ contains Makefile and component.mk files, used for the legacy Make based build system. 
They are not used or needed when building with CMake and idf.py.
